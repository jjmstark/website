Ethereum offers us hardness. We can give Ethereum code and receive a very strong guarantee that it will run any time we call on it. We can give Ethereum data and know with certainty it will still be available in the future, unaltered and uncorrupted.
These simple building blocks give rise to more complex forms of coordination. Money. Contracts. Governance. Identity.</description></item><item><title>What was Bitcoin's total transaction volume in 2021?</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/bitcointxvolume/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/bitcointxvolume/</guid><description>By Josh Stark &amp;amp; Bruno Lulinski
In the Year in Ethereum 2021, we published a chart comparing the total transaction volume of the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Last year, Ethereum transferred approximately $11.6 trillion (ETH and ERC-20s), and Bitcoin transferred approximately $4.6 trillion (BTC and USDT).
After publishing, we saw a graph from Galaxy Digital claiming that in 2021 Bitcoin had settled $12.41 trillion USD:
Ark Invest also posted a chart with similar figures, showing Bitcoin settled $13.</description></item><item><title>Atoms, Institutions, Blockchains</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/aib/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/aib/</guid><description>0. What do a book, a radio broadcast, and the human voice all have in common?
Today the answer is easy: they all contain information.
But if you asked someone the same question 100 years ago, they would struggle. They would not have easily identified that these different things all share an abstract property like “information”.
The modern idea of information is a recent invention. It was not until the 1940s that new communications technologies pushed people working on the cutting edge to articulate that there was something universal underlying sound, electromagnetic waves, symbols on paper, and much more.</description></item><item><title>The Year in Ethereum 2021</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2021/</guid><description>By Josh Stark &amp;amp; Evan Van Ness
Ethereum is the foundation for a digital civilization.
It is hardened, secure, and reliable. It is the bedrock necessary to support the digital cities being built on top of it.
Those cities are growing fast. Because Ethereum is open to everyone, many different users have found reasons to build on it:
Markets use it as financial infrastructure Artists use it to give permanence to their work Assets use it as a settlement layer Communities use it to govern shared resources This year Ethereum applications exploded into public consciousness.</description></item><item><title>The Year in Ethereum 2020</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2020/</guid><description>👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 20, 2021 on Medium.
Ethereum is the digital frontier.
Because it is open and programmable, Ethereum offers a vast uncharted expanse filled with opportunity.
Over the last few years, this frontier has attracted its first major settlements. The freewheeling bazaar of decentralized finance (“DeFi”) has grown into a sector that is beginning to compete with Silicon Valley. This year, a second ecosystem began to put down roots: the creator economy of cryptoart, music, and media.</description></item><item><title>The Year in Ethereum 2019</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2019/</guid><description>👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 22, 2020 on Medium.
Ethereum began as a blank canvas.
Ethereum is an open, permissionless blockchain that developers can use to create any kind of application they want.
This year, the early strokes laid down on that canvas began to form into a coherent picture.
You don’t have to squint so much to see the direction Ethereum is going. Protocols and applications built on Ethereum are beginning to find product-market fit, quickly building communities of thousands of paying users.</description></item></channel></rss>
