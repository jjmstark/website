Ethereum is the foundation for a digital civilization.
It is hardened, secure, and reliable. It is the bedrock necessary to support the digital cities being built on top of it.
Those cities are growing fast. Because Ethereum is open to everyone, many different users have found reasons to build on it:
Markets use it as financial infrastructure Artists use it to give permanence to their work Assets use it as a settlement layer Communities use it to govern shared resources This year Ethereum applications exploded into public consciousness.</description></item><item><title>The Year in Ethereum 2020</title><link>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jjmstark.github.io/website/posts/yie2020/</guid><description>👋 Note: Originally published on Jan 20, 2021 on Medium.

Ethereum began as a blank canvas.
Ethereum is an open, permissionless blockchain that developers can use to create any kind of application they want.
This year, the early strokes laid down on that canvas began to form into a coherent picture.
You don’t have to squint so much to see the direction Ethereum is going. Protocols and applications built on Ethereum are beginning to find product-market fit, quickly building communities of thousands of paying users.</description></item></channel></rss>
